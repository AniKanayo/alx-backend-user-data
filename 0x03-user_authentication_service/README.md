# User Authentication Service

The User Authentication Service is a practical solution for implementing user authentication
and authorization in your applications. This service provides secure user management, registration,
login, and access control features to ensure that only authorized users can access your application's resources.

## Features

 **User Registration**: Allow users to create new accounts by providing their email address
and a secure password. Passwords are hashed and stored securely to protect user data.

**User Login**: Enable users to log into their accounts using their registered email and
password combination. Passwords are securely compared with the stored hashed values.

**Password Recovery**: Implement a password recovery mechanism that allows users to reset
their passwords if they forget them. This can be done through a password reset link sent to their registered email.

**Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions.
Define roles such as "Admin," "User," and more, and assign specific permissions to each role.
Only authorized users can access certain features or data based on their roles.

**Session Management**: Manage user sessions to ensure users stay logged in across multiple
interactions with the application. Implement session timeouts and secure session storage.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhance security by allowing users to enable two-factor
authentication. This involves an additional verification step, such as a time-based one-time
password (TOTP) generated by a mobile app.

**Secure Storage**: Safely store user data, including passwords and sensitive information,
using industry-standard encryption techniques.

**Security Measures**: Implement security best practices, such as salting and hashing passwords,
protecting against SQL injection attacks, and preventing cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone this repository to your project directory.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/user-authentication-service.git
   ```

**Configuration**: Modify the configuration files to match your application's needs.
Configure your database connection settings, session timeout values, and security settings.

**Database Setup**: Set up the required database tables to store user information.
Use the provided SQL scripts or migrations for your chosen database technology.

**API Endpoints**: Implement API endpoints for user registration, login, password recovery,
and any other features your application requires.

**User Roles and Permissions**: Define the roles and their corresponding permissions in your
application. Ensure that you enforce these permissions throughout your application's logic.

**Session Management**: Implement session management to handle user authentication and track
their interactions. Refresh sessions periodically and handle session timeouts.

**Password Security**: Utilize strong password policies and hashing mechanisms.
Consider using a well-established library for password hashing and validation.

**Testing**: Thoroughly test your authentication service. Ensure that registration,
login, password recovery, and access control scenarios are all properly tested.

## Usage Example

```python
from authentication_service import UserService

# Create a new user
user_service = UserService()
user_service.register_user("user@example.com", "securepassword")

# User login
user = user_service.login_user("user@example.com", "securepassword")

# Access control example
if user.has_permission("admin"):
    # Grant access to admin-only features
    pass
else:
    # User does not have necessary permissions
    pass
```
